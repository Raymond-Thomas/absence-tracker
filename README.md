# Absence Tracker App

This is a simple Flask-based web application that allows users to submit absence requests via a styled HTML form. The project was built as part of my portfolio to demonstrate modern web deployment practices using **Azure App Service** and **GitHub integration**.

A Flask-based Absence Tracker web app with full CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps and GitHub.


## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Python & Flask** ‚Äì Lightweight backend built with Python and Flask for routing and handling form data.
- **HTML & CSS** ‚Äì Frontend templates using index.html and submit.html, located in the templates folder.
- **GitHub** ‚Äì All project code is stored in a public GitHub repository, used for version control and deployment.
- **Azure App Service** ‚Äì The live application is hosted on Microsoft Azure using App Service and deployed automatically via GitHub Actions.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Was Built

1. **Local Development**
   - Created a Flask app with form routing and rendering using render_template().
   - Styled the pages with embedded CSS for a polished and clean UI.

2. **Version Control with GitHub**
   - Created a public GitHub repository to host the project.
   - Added all files (app.py, HTML templates, requirements.txt) and pushed to main branch.

3. **Deployment with Azure**
   - Created a new Azure Web App via the Azure Portal.
   - Connected the Azure App Service to my GitHub repository.
   - Enabled GitHub Actions for continuous deployment on new commits to main.

4. **Live Deployment**
   - Azure automatically pulls and builds the app when changes are committed.
   - Accessible via the Azure-provided domain:  
     (https://absence-tracker-raymond-avhrawc8ddhcdehc.centralus-01.azurewebsites.net/)
     
5. ## Deployment

This app is live and deployed on [Azure App Service](https://absence-tracker-raymond.azurewebsites.net).  
CI/CD is fully configured with Azure DevOps and GitHub.

The pipeline is triggered automatically on every push to the `main` branch, installing dependencies and deploying to production.

‚ö†Ô∏è *Pipeline execution is currently pending free-tier approval from Microsoft. Once approved, updates will deploy automatically.*



## üí° Lessons & Takeaways

- Learned how to connect GitHub with Azure for automated deployments.
- Understood the structure of Flask apps and how templates are rendered.
- Gained experience using cloud infrastructure to host web applications publicly.
